# News Article Topic Classification Using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory

In today's digital era, the ever-growing volume of news articles requires faster and more accurate topic classification. This study aims to implement a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to classify topics in news articles. 

The data for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's AG News Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset). The dataset consists of labeled news articles, which undergo preprocessing steps such as tokenization, normalization, and embedding generation.

The model is then trained and tested to classify each article into exactly one appropriate topic. Evaluation results show that the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9147, along with high precision, recall, and F1-score.
